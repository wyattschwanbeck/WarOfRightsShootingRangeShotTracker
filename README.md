# WarOfRightsShootingRangeShotTracker
The goal of this program is to record shots on War of Rights Shooting range to
assist with accuracy and consistancy in shots.
Currently the code is not dynamic and was written to capture footage via
1920X1080 resolution on a second monitor.
Changing values for monitor variable on the functions Capture_Sights and Capture_Results in main.py
will allow you to adjust for screen resolution.

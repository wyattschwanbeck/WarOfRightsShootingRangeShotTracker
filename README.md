# WarOfRightsShootingRangeShotTracker
The goal of this program is to record shots on War of Rights Shooting range to
assist with accuracy and consistancy in shots.
Currently the code is dynamic and was written to capture either target practice shots on the shooting range or shot cams during matches.
